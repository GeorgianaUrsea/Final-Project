<h2>Testing Process:</h2>

The test process was performed based on the standard test process as described below.


<h3>1.1 Test Planning</h3>

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the modules from the (https://epantofi.ro/) website.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan. The test plan that was created for this project can be found here:
[Test_Plan.odt](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14724518/Test_Plan.odt)


<h4><strong>1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated:</strong></h4>

<h4>1.1.4 Test scope</h4>


Tests in scope:

Functional testing will be applied to verify the login.

Non-functional testing will be applied to verify filters.

We check the filter mode using functional testing.

We use retesting for filters and login.

We use regression testing for filters and login.


Tests not in scope:

- For the website "www.epantofi.ro" check if the discount code "st25" can be applied.
  
- For the website "www.epantofi.ro" check if the " Centrul de ajutor" button is functional.
  
- For the website "www.epantofi.ro" check if the language in which the website is translated can be changed.

<h4>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h4>

The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

<h3>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</h3>

The monitoring and control stage is carried out for the smooth development of the test project.

The main reason why this stage is carried out is to check the quality of the testing, to perform all the necessary steps to fix the errors, to meet the deadline.

It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.

<h3>1.4 Test Design</h3>

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test cases can be accessed here:


[Test_Cases.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14724168/Test_Cases.pdf)






<h3>1.5 Test Implementation</h3>

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

-The test environment

-Functional laptop

-An existing account

-Internet access

-Knowledge of the documentation


<h3>1.6 Test Execution</h3>


Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: ![raport2](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Manual_Testing_epantofi_Jira/assets/92721437/2e3f735c-1f2d-4430-8ae8-da7648720048)


 [cycle_summary_execution.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14539421/cycle_summary_execution.pdf)

In this project, 2 stories were created and 12 test cases were tested.

In the 12 test cases, 3 BUGs were identified. The priority of the 3 bugs is medium and high.

The 3 BUGs are to be fixed, after fixing, retesting and regression testing will be carried out.

I have used functional and non-functional testing.

The aditional risks can be: 

-after a certain number of clicks, the site will be blocked

-hard to find filters

-users do not understand the login process

-users cannot login using other applications


Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: [Bug_reports.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14539509/Bug_reports.pdf)

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.


<h3>1.7 Test Completion</h3>


Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team

The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: ![traceability_matrix](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Manual_Testing_epantofi_Jira/assets/92721437/da0ae8fe-8ff6-4edf-8c94-1502cc57b0c4)

Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows:

-TEST PASS- 9 OF 12 

In this project, 2 stories were created and 12 test cases were tested.

In the 12 test cases, 3 BUGs were identified. The priority of the 3 bugs is medium and high, from which the priority is: 1 is high and 2 are medium.

The 3 BUGs are to be fixed, after fixing, retesting and regression testing will be carried out.
