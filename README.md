#The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Application under test:


The final project will be split into 2 sections: Theoretical section and Testing section.

Tools used:

Functional specifications

-> Stories, Test-cases, Test-conditions, Traceability matrix, Test execution, Risk analysis, Bug-ticket.

1 Testing section

1.1 Test Planning

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the X module from the OrangeHRM application.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated
Vlad - manager
ALex - junior tester
ALin - senior
ALexandra - automation tester
Roxana - product owner
Amalia - project manager


1.1.2 Entry criteria defined
Complete documentation
Good team
High performance hardware
Windows version 4.1
1.1.3 Exit criteria defined
No Critical test case open

1.1.4 Test scope

Tests in scope:
Tests not in scope:
1.1.5 Risks detected

Project risks:new people in the team who do not have knowledge
Misunderstandings in the team, loss of time, failure to meet the deadline
The risk is to run out of budget
The risk of being without employees
Bad, old hardware
Poor code quality, developers

Product risks:does not correspond to the requirements of the client, documentation
- application too complete/difficult/not user friendly
- the activity segment
- functionality problems/fluctuations in product quality
- the correct non-functionality of the payment method
- the risk of compatibility of uploaded files

1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.

1.3 Test Analysis

The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Dependents module. The following test conditions were found:

1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:

Test cases: -> enter here test cases or at least the titles

The test cases with steps can be viewed here: test_cases.pdf

1.5 Test Implementation

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

1.6 Test Execution

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: cycle_summary_execution.pdf
Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: created_bugs.pdf
enter here bug titles
1.7 Test Completion

Exit criteria was evaluated and passed
The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: Traceability_matrix.csv
Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows.... -> describe the final report
