#The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Application under test:


The final project will be split into 2 sections: Theoretical section and Testing section.

Tools used: JIRA

Functional specifications

-> Stories, Test-cases, Test-conditions, Traceability matrix, Test execution, Risk analysis, Bug-ticket.

1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:


Test cases:
