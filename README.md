<h4>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control<h4>

The monitoring and control stage is carried out for the smooth development of the test project.

The main reason why this stage is carried out is to check the quality of the testing, to perform all the necessary steps to fix the errors, to meet the deadline.

It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.

<h4>1.4 Test Design</h4>

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test cases can be accessed here:


[Test_Cases.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14724168/Test_Cases.pdf)






<h4>1.5 Test Implementation</h4>

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

-The test environment

-Functional laptop

-An existing account

-Internet access

-Knowledge of the documentation


<h4>1.6 Test Execution</h4>


Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: [cycle_summary_execution.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14539421/cycle_summary_execution.pdf)


Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: [Bug_reports.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14539509/Bug_reports.pdf)

Full regression testing is needed on the impacted areas after the bugs are fixed and retesting will be done for every functionality that was previously failed.


<h4>1.7 Test Completion</h4>


Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team

The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: [Traceability_matrix.pdf](https://github.com/GeorgianaUrsea/Final-Project/files/14539540/Traceability_matrix.pdf)

Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows:

-TEST PASS- 9 OF 12 

In this project, 2 stories were created and 12 test cases were tested.

In the 12 test cases, 3 BUGs were identified. The priority of the 3 bugs is medium and high, from which the priority is: 1 is high and 2 are medium.
